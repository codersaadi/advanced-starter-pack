## üèóÔ∏è What's Included?

This repository is a Turborepo monorepo.

### Apps

-   `web`: The main Next.js 15 application. Includes the marketing site, user dashboard, blog, and all user-facing pages.
-   `docs`: A documentation site built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.ui.shadcn.com/), perfect for product guides and API references.
-   `storybook`: An isolated environment for developing and showcasing UI components from the `@repo/ui` package.
-   `email`: A visual preview environment for email templates using `react-email`.

### Packages (Shared Logic)

-   `@repo/core`: The heart of the application. Contains database schemas (Drizzle), tRPC routers, authentication logic, payment integrations, and core business logic.
-   `@repo/ui`: The shared UI library based on Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives.
-   `@repo/i18n`: The internationalization powerhouse. Contains locale files, configuration, and scripts for AI-powered translation generation.
-   `@repo/env`: Centralized and validated environment variable management using `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`.
-   `@repo/email`: Defines email templates (using `react-email`) and the abstracted `sendEmail` function.
-   `@repo/db`: Contains Drizzle schema, migration scripts, and database utilities.
-   `@repo/notification`: Handles notifications logic, with a pre-configured setup for [Knock](https://knock.app).
-   `@repo/shared`: Shared constants, types, and utility functions used across the monorepo.
-   `@repo/webhooks`: Type-safe webhook handlers.
-   `@repo/locales`: Raw JSON locale files for different languages (`en-US`, `ar`, etc.).
-   `tooling/typescript-config`: Shared `tsconfig.json` configurations for the monorepo.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (v9 or higher)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for running a local PostgreSQL database)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codersaadi/apex-kit.git my-saas-app
cd my-saas-app
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses a set of `.env` files for configuration. Copy the examples and fill in your credentials.

```bash
# Copy the main environment file for the web app and core services
cp .env.example .env

# Copy the email-specific environment file
cp packages/email/.env.example packages/email/.env
```

Now, open `.env` and `packages/email/.env` and provide the necessary values. **At a minimum, you'll need:**

1.  `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
2.  `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret for Next-Auth. Run `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate one.
3.  Authentication Provider keys (e.g., `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, etc.).
4.  Email Provider credentials (e.g., `AWS_SES_REGION` and keys, or `RESEND_KEY`).

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

Make sure your PostgreSQL server (e.g., via Docker) is running.

```bash
# Push the Drizzle schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

For production, you'll use migrations:
```bash
# Generate a new migration after schema changes
pnpm --filter @repo/core db:generate

# Apply migrations
pnpm --filter @repo/core db:migrate
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm web dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Deep Dive

### Authentication

You can easily switch between or combine `Clerk` and `Next-Auth`.

-   **To use Clerk:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env` file.
-   **To use Next-Auth:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEXT_AUTH="1"` and configure your desired OIDC providers (e.g., `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`).

### Email Provider

The email service is designed to be pluggable. Configure it in `packages/email/.env`:

-   Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER` to `"ses"`, `"resend"`, or `"nodemailer"`.
-   Fill in the corresponding credentials for the chosen provider.

For example, to use **AWS SES**:
```env
# packages/email/.env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="ses"
EMAIL_FROM="Your Name <noreply@yourverifieddomain.com>"
AWS_SES_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
```

## üöÄ Deployment

The recommended hosting provider is **Vercel**, as it offers seamless integration with Next.js, including support for Edge Functions and caching.

1.  Push your repository to GitHub/GitLab.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Turborepo monorepo. Set the root directory to `apps/web`.
4.  Add all the required environment variables from your `.env` file to the Vercel project settings.

And you're done! Vercel will handle the build and deployment process.
